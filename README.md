### Mobile-first Design

The design approach starts with the mobile experience first, ensuring optimal usability and engagement on smaller screens. I prioritize content and functionality that are essential for on-the-go users, leading to a clean and intuitive interface on mobile devices. This mobile-first strategy also lays a solid foundation for scaling up to larger screens with a consistent user experience.

Here's how Dismoviery looks on mobile devices versus desktops:
